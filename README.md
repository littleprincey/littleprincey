ðŸ’¼ You can find my security blog in the repo, a fullstack blog I have built with react-redux from scratch where I post about the cyber security learnings I am on!

Currently building that blog, doing a Udemy course on Ethical Hacking and engaging in different mediums on Cyber Security, keeping all my skills from bootcamp fresh!


ðŸ’» Another side project i'm working on is (c)literature, a site im building in JS with a growing database of all the incredible books and things by women that i've discovered in the last few years.
